== What is Odise? ==

Marketing will be more engaging and effective if it’s tailored for each and every user. Imagine you give every user their own version of your website with personalized content, custom pops and tailored email campaigns based on each user’s attributes, history and behavior.

Odise is your new marketing assistant that reveals the behavioral patterns of your website’s users and helps you personalize marketing for them across their journey from the moment they arrive to your website as a visitor until they are a loyal customer of yours.

== Discover and oversee your customer journey ==

Odise provides a multi-dimensional insight into your website users’ journey across your website in different stages – from acquisition to nurturing to conversion and retention.

* Define a timeframe
* Choose a dimension to look through such as: Location, Source, Landing page, Subscription and Purchase
* Or choose multiple dimensions to unveil more specific funnels:
* Define personalized content and campaigns for relevant funnels

== Automate all your marketing activities within a ‘If This Then That’ dashboard ==

* Having discovered different working and failing funnels, define automation rules to serve each funnel (as broadly or specifically as you want) its own personalized experience
* Organize your rules over a threefold bird-eye view of your website: Guests, Leads, Customers
* Define simple ‘If This Then That’ style automation rules to serve personalized content and marketing campaigns to each user type within their column
* Select a condition for your rule: Source, Location, Device, URL parameter, Date, Page Visit and User Behavior (Away, Scroll, Time Spent, Orders Count, Abandoned Cart, Purchased Product)
* Choose an action for your rule: Show Page, Personalize Web Page, Send Email and Show Popup
* Get a visual report of your automation rules performance

Sample possible Automation rules:

IF `UTM=CampaignX` THEN `Show landing Y`
IF `User location is Brazil ` THEN `Show Brazilian homepage`
IF `User purchased X times` THEN `Send appreciation email`
IF `Returning user` THEN `Email a coupon`
IF `User intends to exit` THEN `Show popup`
IF `It’s Christmas` THEN `Show Christmas landing page`
